# Trip Planner Agent - Documentation

This document provides comprehensive information about the Trip Planner Agent, its features, usage, and development details.

## Overview

The Trip Planner Agent is an intelligent system designed to assist users in planning their trips efficiently and effectively. Leveraging advanced algorithms and potentially large language models (LLMs), the agent can understand user preferences, suggest destinations, create itineraries, and provide relevant travel information.

## Key Features

*   **Destination Discovery:**
    *   Suggests destinations based on user-specified criteria (e.g., budget, interests, travel dates, group size).
    *   Provides detailed information about potential destinations, including attractions, activities, and local culture.
    *   Offers alternative destination suggestions if the initial choices are unavailable or unsuitable.
*   **Itinerary Generation:**
    *   Creates detailed day-by-day itineraries based on the chosen destination and user preferences.
    *   Optimizes travel routes and schedules to minimize travel time and maximize sightseeing opportunities.
    *   Suggests activities, restaurants, and accommodations tailored to the user's interests and budget.
*   **Preference Management:**
    *   Learns user preferences over time, improving the accuracy and relevance of future recommendations.
    *   Allows users to explicitly define and modify their preferences (e.g., preferred cuisine, activity types, accommodation style).
    *   Handles diverse user profiles (e.g., solo travelers, families, couples).
*   **Real-time Information:**
    *   Integrates with external APIs to provide up-to-date information on flights, hotels, and local events.
    *   Alerts users to potential disruptions (e.g., flight delays, weather warnings).
    *   Provides information on local transportation options.
*   **Budgeting:**
    *   Helps users estimate the cost of their trip based on their chosen destination, activities, and accommodation preferences.
    *   Suggests budget-friendly alternatives when appropriate.
    *   Tracks expenses during the trip (optional feature).
*   **Customization:**
    *   Allows users to customize their itineraries by adding, removing, or modifying activities.
    *   Provides options for different travel styles (e.g., luxury, budget, adventure).
* **Natural Language Interaction:**
    * Enables users to interact with the agent using natural language, making the planning process more intuitive.
    * Understands complex queries and can ask clarifying questions.

## Usage

### Getting Started
